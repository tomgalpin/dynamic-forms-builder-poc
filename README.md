# Dynamic Forms Build Proof of Concept

This application shows how easy and simple it could to have the frontend respond to a Headless CMS or the backend for all or most of our forms.

## Used:

- (Mantine)[https://ui.mantine.dev/] for Froms and Components
- I did not use a headless CMS because I started to and then didn't want to spend the time learning it in depth.

## Run Locally:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
